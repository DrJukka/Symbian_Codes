<VERSION>080</VERSION> // version needs to be 080 currently, may change in future editions..

// 080 only supports one IMPLEMENTATION per each plug-in

<IMPLEMENTATION> // the implementation info needs to be between IMPLEMENTATION tags

<TYPE>FILEHANDLER</TYPE> // Type tells what this plug-in does, and where it is shown
			 // - FILEHANDLER : normal file handler, not shown in any menu, just used to handling 					 //	files (plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserFileHandler)
			 // - FILESENDER : File sender plug-in, will be shown in "Send via" menu 
			 //	(plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserFileSender)
			 // - FILERECEIVER: Not included in 0.82 version yet, will propably have a "receive via" 			 //	menu implemented later (plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserBaseHandler)
			 // - FILEFOLDER: Handler that is shown in drives view (like mail folders)
			 //	(plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserBaseHandler)
			 // - OPENWITH : plug-in, will be shown in "Open with" menu 
			 //	(plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserFileHandler)
			 // - FILERECOGNIZER : File recognizer
			 //	(plug-in needs to be derived from CYBrowserFileRecognizer)


<SUPPORT> // values between SUPPORT tags identify the file types supported by the plug-in
	  //  in case there are multiple filetypes, you need to have multiple 	<SUPPORT></SUPPORT> 
	  //  pairs with the data.

<FILETYPE>YTools/Myfile</FILETYPE> 	// normal filetype string supported by the plug-in
<TYPEPARTIAL>image</TYPEPARTIAL>	// partial filetype string (left part) to support multiple
					// file types at one line (for example image, means image/gif, 
					// image/jpg etc.) its can only have FILETYPE or TYPEPARTIAL
					// not both inside the same <SUPPORT></SUPPORT> pair.

<RFILE>YES</RFILE>		   	// add this line if the plug-in can handle RFile functions

<NEWWITHFILES>YES</NEWWITHFILES>	// add this line if the plug-in supports making new files
					// with file array (i.e. will be used in paste-files-to-new-file menu)

<NEWEMPY>YES</NEWEMPY>			// add this line if the plug-in supports making new empty files
					// will be added to the "New File" menu list
