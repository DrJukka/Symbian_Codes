#define ktx_str_HELP4			"Note that theme are scheduled as well as previous schedules are re-freshed only after exiting the application. For best usability, each schedule should be spaced two minutes apart from each other. The actual scheduling is handled by background application that is also automatically started when the device is started. No message scheduling will appear while the device is off."
